Parallel Corpus
===============

Parallel corpus is very helpful for various NLP tasks, especially for statistical machine translation.

Following are some sources of Malayalam-English parallel corpus:

1. [OPUS](http://opus.nlpl.eu/): OPUS is a growing collection of translated texts from the web. They collect the translations from various sources such as Ubuntu/KDE/Gnome localizations, Opensubtitles, TED etc. They publish the data in various formats such as TMX, Moses, XML.  [Apache JOSHUA](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/JOSHUA/Apache+Joshua+Home) project tries to build MT engines based on this corpus. Reference: J. Tiedemann, 2012, [Parallel Data, Tools and Interfaces in OPUS](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2012/pdf/463_Paper.pdf). In Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2012)
